In this project i will aquire data by recording the audio of different engines that run normaly at idle, and engines that run poorly with a faulty ignition system.

With my Particle Photon 2 connected to a PDM micrphone i will aquire as much audio data as possible, sending the data over TCP to saved on my laptop.
The data will be collected from different cars at idle. Some will idle normally with no faulty ignition system, others will have a faulty iginition system implemented.
Can i train a tiny ML model to spot a faulty ignition system in a car?
